# -WIP-document-similarity-performance-tests-on-Reddit-communities
An ongoing research project testing document similarity algorithmns on Reddit community. Currently have: Euclidian distance(normalized), cosine distance, BERT embeddings paired with cosine distance(subreddit descriptions only), and user-based(polling the number of "mutual users" between subreddits)

This code is mostly for demonstration purposes only, and will need work before plug-and-play utility
In the meantime, however, one can look at read_subreddit_data.py and common_comments2_functions.py to get the general gist of the data analysis methods used
and also testing_joint.py to see how they are tested
